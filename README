This repository is meant to organize code and other TEXT works I have made for
courses I am taking for the Winter 2017 semester at Eastern Michigan University.

There are a few rules for this repository and they are as follows:

    1.  No binary files. None. Any needed will be kept at a different location.
        All files must be human readable with a text editor.*
    2.  Each course receives it's own branch. They will be named in this format:
        XXXX### (for example COSC314).
    3.  Each assignment/project gets its own directory under the appropriate
        branch.
    4.  No IDE specific files/directories. This is mainly to avoid unneeded
        clutter.
    5.  All programs *should* be accompanied by a Makefile, to make things quick
        to compile and run, if needed.
    6.  All branches must be orphans.
    7.  All code must follow my general coding style, unless there's a strong
        objection from an instructor.
    8.  All code here is licensed under an ISC license unless otherwise stated,
        see LICENSE in the master branch.
    9.  All non-code creative works are licensed under a Creative Commons
        Attribution 4.0 International License unless otherwise stated. See CC for
        in the master branch.
    10. Any changes to this file must be clearly documented in the commit
        message.

* The only acceptible exception are files that are small-ish and necessary like
  images and binary data files.
